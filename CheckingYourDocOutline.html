    Problem- You want to view your document's content outline.
    Solution- Run your page through the HTML5 Outliner tool: http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/.
    HTML5 has an outline algorithm that calculates the structure of a web content.
    Explicit sectioning- For the main document outline, section and aside each introduce a new section in the
    outline, while the heading(s) within each form the outline content. This is known as
    explicit sectioning.
    <section>
        <h1>Heading</h1>
        <article><h2>Article1</h2></article>
        <article><h2>Article2</h2></article> 
    </section>
    This markup would generate the following document outline:
    1. Heading
    1.1 Article1
    1.2 Article2
    Heading Levels - Heading in Html are ranked with h1 as highest and h6 as lowest.
    Implicit section -  An implicit section starts with a new heading and is positioned in the document outline
    according to that heading’s rank in relation to a previous heading. If a heading is a lower
    rank than its predecessor, it opens a new subsection in the outline. If a heading is a
    higher rank, it closes the previous section and opens a new one.
    <section>
 <h1>You've Got the <code>DOCTYPE</code>, Now What?</h1>
 <h2>Simplified <code>link</code>s and <code>script</code>s</h2>
 <p>HTML5's more flexible and simplified syntax ...</p>
 <h2>Block-Level Links</h2>
 <p>With HTML5, <code>a</code>s can contain block ...</p>
 <h3>Looking Back</h3>
 <p>In earlier versions of HTML, you had to ...</p>
 <h2>Add Structure</h2>
 <p>HTML5 gives us several new elements to add ...</p>
</section>
This example utilizes heading rank, rather than explicit sectioning elements, to generate
the following outline:
1. You’ve Got the DOCTYPE, Now What?
1.1 Simplified links and scripts
1.2 Block-level Links
1.2.1 Looking Back
1.3 Add Structure
