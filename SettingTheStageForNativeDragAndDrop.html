<!--
    Problem - You want to allow users to drag and drop content on your web page.
    Note - simple addition of draggable att does not create drap and drop functionality on its own.
    draggable simply allows you to specify the elements that can be dragged.
    To achieve the desired drag and drop functionality, you need Js to:
    1. Tell the browser where the draggable element can be dropped(the drop "zone")
    2. Tell the browser what to do with the element once it has been dropped.
