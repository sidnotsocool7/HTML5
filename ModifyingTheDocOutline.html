<!--
    Problem - You have a primary page title and tagline marked up with headings(h1,h2), but you don't want the tagline
    in your document outline.
    Solution - Contain both the elements with <hgroup> heading
        <hgroup>
            <h1>HTML1</h1>
            <h2>HTML2</h2>
        </hgroup>
    hgroup hides all the headings except the highest ranked from document outline(even if h1 is placed below h2).
