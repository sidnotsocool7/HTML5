    Problem- You need to define character encoding for your web page.
    Solution- In <head> add a meta declaration for your character set.
    Note- Some years ago, Google faced a croos-scripting site vulnerablilty beacuse of not defining.
    If not defined it will take from HTTP server response header(Content-Type) and if not there it will take some default
    If you want to include characters outside UTF-8, use NCR(Numeric character references) like
    &#169, &copy.
