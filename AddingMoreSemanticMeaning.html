<!--
    Problem - You want to markup content correctly.
    Solution - Apply markup in a semantic manner.
    Note - Semantic markup is a markup that describes the content it conatains, rather than what the 
    content should look like. This means coding paragraphs with p element, titles with heading element
    and so on.
    Sometimes referred to as POSH(Plain Old Semantic HTML), semantic markup eschews the use of presentational 
    elements like font or table for layout purposes.
    POSH focuses on content. HTML5 redefined several elements like b and i. 
    Following presentational elements and attributes are gone - 
    Elements - 
    basefont, big, center, font, plaintext, s, strike, tt, u.
    Attributes - 
    align, background, bgcolor, border, cellpadding, cellspacing, height, nowrap, valign, width
