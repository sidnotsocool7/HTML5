    Problem - You want to know what kind of syntax coding style to use.
    Solution - 1. Code your tag names in lowercase.
    2. Enclose all attribute values in quotes.
    3. Close all elements with content. Knowing where a div ends just makes for clearer code.
    Whatever coding style you use, consistency is the key. There is no right or wrong style in HTML5.
