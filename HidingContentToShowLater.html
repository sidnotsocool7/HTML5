<!--
    Problem - You have content that you wnat to hide until after a user logs in.
    Note - hidden attribute should be applied that is not yet or longer relevant to the current user view
    and, as such, should not be rendered by the browsers.
    The DOM and machines like search engines can still access the content and can be targeted via Js, 
    by removed the attribute and display it.
    In css it can be achieved by visibilty: hidden or display:none
    It should be only used for semantic purposes.
